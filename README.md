Selenium Grid In A Box - All you need for a simplified setup &amp; install of Selenium Grid

What is Selenium Grid In A Box?
--------------------------------
_Selenium Grid In a Box_ is designed to make the installation and setup of a Selenium Grid on a Windows machine a super-simple process.

Rather than having to download & install the individual components for the Selenium Grid Hub, and each browsers manually, all you need to do is to copy the _Selenium Grid In A Box folder_ to your windows machine, set some environment variables for configuration, and away you go!

It includes :
- Selenium Grid _(Standalone Jar 2.26.0)_
- Mozilla Firefox 16 _(Portable Edition, thanks to PortableApps)_
- Google Chrome 23 _(Portable Edition, thanks to PortableApps)_
- Internet Explorer _(whichever version available on your Windows machine)_
- JavaSE 7
- Scripts to install the Selenium Grid Hub, and the above browsers as a service _(thanks to Tanuki Java Service Wrapper)_

__I will keep the components up to date and repackage once they are tested and known to be working together__
